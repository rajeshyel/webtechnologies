The XMLHttpRequest object is the key to AJAX. Besides XML, XMLHttpRequest can be used to fetch data in other formats, e.g. JSON or even plain text.<br>
Listed below are some of the methods and properties that you have to get familiar with.<br>

XMLHttpRequest Methods<br>
abort():Cancels the current request.<br>
getAllResponseHeaders():Returns the complete set of HTTP headers as a string.<br>
getResponseHeader( headerName ):Returns the value of the specified HTTP header.<br>
open( method, URL )<br>
open( method, URL, async )<br>
open( method, URL, async, userName )<br>
open( method, URL, async, userName, password )<br>
Specifies the method, URL, and other optional attributes of a request.<br>

The method parameter can have a value of "GET", "POST", or "HEAD". Other HTTP methods such as "PUT" and "DELETE" (primarily used in REST applications) may be possible.<br>
The "async" parameter specifies whether the request should be handled asynchronously or not. "true" means that the script processing carries on after the send() method without waiting for a response, and "false" means that the script waits for a response before continuing script processing.<br>
send( content ):Sends the request.<br>
setRequestHeader( label, value ):Adds a label/value pair to the HTTP header to be sent.<br>

XMLHttpRequest Properties
onreadystatechange: An event handler for an event that fires at every state change.<br>
readyState:The readyState property defines the current state of the XMLHttpRequest object.<br>

The following table provides a list of the possible values for the readyState property âˆ’
State	Description
0	The request is not initialized.
1	The request has been set up.
2	The request has been sent.
3	The request is in process.
4	The request is completed.
readyState = 0 After you have created the XMLHttpRequest object, but before you have called the open() method.<br>
readyState = 1 After you have called the open() method, but before you have called send().<br>
readyState = 2 After you have called send().<br>
readyState = 3 After the browser has established a communication with the server, but before the server has completed the response.<br>
readyState = 4 After the request has been completed, and the response data has been completely received from the server.<br>
responseText:Returns the response as a string.<br>
responseXML: Returns the response as XML. This property returns an XML document object, which can be examined and parsed using the W3C DOM node tree methods and properties.<br>

status: Returns the status as a number (e.g., 404 for "Not Found" and 200 for "OK").<br>
statusText:Returns the status as a string (e.g., "Not Found" or "OK").<br>
